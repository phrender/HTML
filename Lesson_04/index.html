        	It's hard and tedious to always style the different tags.<br>
            But there is a way to style your webpage using CSS - Cascade Style Sheet,
            which can be used to create a default and reuseable sheet to 
            create new pages from with ease.
        </div>
        
        <div id="test">
        	This is a DIV box using a id to get another cusomized look than the default one desctibed above.
            And they are case-sensive, which means you can't enter a name like: "ThIs" and call it with: "this"
            you have to call it using: "ThIs" or it will inherit the standard div setting.
        </div>
</body>
